/*things I learn by this program is :-
1)SWITCH only take value in interger not in float or decimal
2)to get exact value(101 rupees 29 paise or in float form) multiplying integer(sallary*9/100) doesn't work so we make another varible which is tax in float to get
answer in float .
3)variable int sallary; for Switch function , and float tax for arithmetic operation to get value in decimal form.
4)Always remember int*int -> int
    and float*int -> float   
    int*float -> float */
